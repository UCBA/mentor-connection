# Teachers (Mitchell, William & Mark)

A teacher/mentor/tutor is someone who has a passion and/or is apathetic to the "student" experience. As an open source platform, the intention is not to monetize or incentivize the service for any user type.

View community guidelines and agree to the terms of service.

We would need the teacher to have a user profile.
